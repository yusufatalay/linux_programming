Implement a function, one_time_init(control, init), that performs the equivalent of
pthread_once(). The control argument should be a pointer to a statically allocated
structure containint a Boolean variable and a mutex. The Boolean variable
indicates whether the function init has already been called, and the mutex controls
access to that variable. To keep implementation simple, you can ignore
possibilities such as init() failing or being cancelled when first called from a thread
(i.e, it is not necessary to devise a scheme whereby, if such an event occurs, the
next thread that calls one_time_init() reattempts the call to init()).
