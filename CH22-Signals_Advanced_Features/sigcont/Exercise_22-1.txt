Section 22.2 noted that if as stopped process that has established a handler for and
blocked SIGCONT is later resumed as a consequence of receiving a SIGCONT, then the
handler is invoked only when SIGCONT is unblocked. Write a program to verify this.
Recall that a process can be stopped by typing the terminal suspend character 
(usually Control-Z) and can be sent a SIGCONT signal using the command kill -CONT 
(or implicitly, using the shell fg command).
