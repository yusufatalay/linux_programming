When we run sig_speed_sigsuspend with 1 million signals the time it takes shown below

```
$ time ./sig_speed_sigsuspend 1000000

When we run sig_speed_sigwaitinfo with 1 million signals the program does not exit, which is weird because 
after failing to run it I checked the solution and it was the same as mine. The book's solution also says I should see 
%40 or %50 improvement in performance. But again the program does not exit.
