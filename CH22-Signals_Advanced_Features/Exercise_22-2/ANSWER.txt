When we run the code the output would be like

```
$ ./real_vs_standard
A mix of real-time and standard signals are blocked
Caught realtime signal 37 (Real-time signal 3)
Caught realtime signal 35 (Real-time signal 1)
Caugh standard signal 18 (Continued)
Caugh standard signal 2 (Interrupt)
Signals are unblocked

```

This means Linux gives priority for real-time signals.
