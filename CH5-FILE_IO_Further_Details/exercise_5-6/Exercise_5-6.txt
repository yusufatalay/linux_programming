After each of the calls to write() in the following code, explain what the content of the ouput file would be, and why?


```
	fd1= open(file, O_RDWR | O_CREAT | O_TRUNC , 0600);
	fd2= dup(fd1);
	fd3= open(file, O_RDWR);

	write(fd1, "Hello,", 6);
	write(fd2, " world",6);
	lseek(fd2,0, SEEK_SET);
	write(fd1, "HELLO,", 6);
	write(fd3, "Gidday",6);
```
