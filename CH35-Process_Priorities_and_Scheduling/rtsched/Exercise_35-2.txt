Write a set-user-ID-root program that is the realtime scheduling analog of nice(1).
The command-line interface of this program should be as follows:

	# ./rtsched policy priority command arg...

In the above command, policy is r for SCHED_RR or f for SCHED_FIFO. This program
should drop its privileged ID before execing the command, for the reasons
described in Sections 9.7.1 and 38.3.
