Use execve() to implement execlp(). You will need to use the stdarg(3) API to handle
the variable-lenght argument list supplied to execlp(). You will also need to use
functions in the malloc package to allocate space for the argument and environment 
vectors. Finally, note that an easy way of checking whether a file exists in a particular
directory and is executable is simply to try execing the file.
