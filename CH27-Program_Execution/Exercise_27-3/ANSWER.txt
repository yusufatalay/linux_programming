When we run the code the output would be like the following
 $ ./Exercise_27-3
     1	#!/bin/cat -n
     2	Hello world

Reason for that is:
Shebang points to the cat program which prints out the supplied file, the -n arg is for
enabling line numbers. In short the file is interpreted by cat program with -n flag
