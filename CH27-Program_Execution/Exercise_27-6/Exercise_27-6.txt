Suppose that a parent process has established a handler for SIGCHLD and also
blocked this signal. Subsequently, one of its children exits, and the parent then
does a wait() to collect the child's status.
What happens when the parent unblocks SIGCHLD? Write a program to verify your answer.
What is the relevance of the result for a program calling the system() function?
