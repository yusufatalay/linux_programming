Is it because the stdout is buffered and the printf() in the provided program does not include any new line characters,
or the program calls fflush() before calling exec(). Therfore the message is located at the stdout's buffer and not printed
because buffer is not full yet, on top of that the program's text and data is replaced by sleep process therefore the message
will not be printed ever.
