All the writes happening to the same file
after the first write the file's content is
	Hello,
after second write 
	Hello, world
after seek command, file cursor is set to the beginning of the file for both opened versions

after third write
	HELLO, world
and after the last one, using the fd3 
	Gidday, world

Reason for the result is not Hello, Gidday is, fd3 is created with open not dup so the file offset values are not shared
