Implement dup() and dup2() using fcntl() and, where neccessary, close().
(You may ignore the fact that dup2() and fcntln() return different errno 
values for some error cases.) For dup2(), remember to handle the special case
where oldfd equals newfd. In this case, you should check whether oldfd is valid
which can be done by, for example, checking if fcntl(oldfd, F_GETFL) succeeds.
If  oldfd is not valid, then the function should return -1 with errno set
to EBADF.
