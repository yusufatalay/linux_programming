Write a program to see how fast the fork() and vfork() system calls are on your
system. Each child process should immediately exit, and the parent shoult wait()
on each child before creating the next. Compare relative differences for these
two system calls with those of Table 28-3. The shell built-in command time can be
used to measure the execution time of a program.
