I have implemented the code here is the part of the output

```
Thread 1: Current value of glob is 82
Thread 1: Current value of glob is 83
Thread 1: Current value of glob is 84
Thread 1: Current value of glob is 85
Thread 1: Current value of glob is 86
Thread 1: Current value of glob is 87
Thread 2: Current value of glob is 85
Thread 1: Current value of glob is 88
Thread 2: Current value of glob is 89
Thread 1: Current value of glob is 90
Thread 1: Current value of glob is 91
Thread 1: Current value of glob is 92
Thread 1: Current value of glob is 93
Thread 1: Current value of glob is 94
```
		

From glob=0 to 87 thread 1 was running then kernel switched to thread 2 and the value that thread was reading was 85.
This happened because of race condition.
