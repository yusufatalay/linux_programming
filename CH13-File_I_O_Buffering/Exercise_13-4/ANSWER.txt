I have tried this exercise with test.c program, however both terminal and file contains the same
data after running the program. I guess this exercise was created with a mistake, printf
flushes its buffer when it come accross a newline character , so the correct exercise code 
should be like this

```
	  printf("If I had mode time, ");
  	  write(STDOUT_FILENO, "I would have written you a shorter letter.\n", 43);
```

right now when this program runs with no modification the output is:

	```
		./a.out                          
		I would have written you a shorter letter.
	```

This happened because write does not buffers its content whereas printf does

Now, in code when we redirect STDOUT to a disk file with dup2, here is the content of the file:

	```
		I would have written you a shorter letter.
		If I had mode time, If I had mode time,
	```
