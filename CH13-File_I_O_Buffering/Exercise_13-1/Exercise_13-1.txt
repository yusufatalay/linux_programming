Using the time built-in command of the shell, try timing the operation of the program in
Listing 4-1 (copy.c) on your system.
	a) Experiment with different file and buffer sizes. You can set the buffer size
	   using the -DBUF_SIZE=nbytes option when compiling the program.
	
	b) Modify the open() system call to include the O_SYNC flag. How much difference	   does this make to the speed for various buffer sizes?
