Modify the program in Listing 7-1 (free_and_sbrk.c) to print out the current
value of the program break after each execution of malloc(). Run the program
specifying a small allocation block size. This will demonstrate that malloc()
doesn't employ sbrk() to adjust the program break on each call, but instead
periodically allocates larger chunks of memory from which it passes back small 
pieces to the caller.
