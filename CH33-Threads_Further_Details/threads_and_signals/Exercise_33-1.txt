Write a program to demonstrate that different threads in the same process can have
different sets of pending signals, as returned by sigpending(). You can do this by using
pthread_kill() to send different signals to two different threads that have blocked
these signals, and then have each of the threads call sigpending() and display 
information about pending signals. (You may find the functions in Listing 20-4
useful).
