Write a network server that stores name-value pairs. The server should allow 
names to be added, deleted, modified, and retrieved by clients. Write one or
more client programs to test the server. Optionally, implement some kind of
security mechanism that allows only the client that created the name to delete
it or to modify the value associated with it.
