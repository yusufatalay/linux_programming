Write a program that measures the bandwidth provided by pipes.
As command-line arguments, the program should accept the number of data blocks
to be sent and the size of each data block. After creating a pipe, the program
splits into two process; a child that writes the data blocks to the pipe as fast
as possible, and a parent that reads the data blocks. After all data has been
read, the parent should print elapsed time required and the bandwidth(bps).
Measure the bandwidth for different data block sizes.
