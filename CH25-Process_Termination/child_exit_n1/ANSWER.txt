When we run the supplemented code here is the output

$ ./child_exit_n1
Child with pid : 13684 about to exit with -1 status
Child exited with 65280
Child exited with 255

The reason that 65280 is printed because the actual return number shifted 8 bits to left.

We can use WEXITSTATUS macro to see the actual exit status of the child process.
