When we run the supplemented code here is the output

$ ./child_exit_n1
Child with pid : 13684 about to exit with -1 status
Child exited with 65280
Child exited with 255

The reason that 65280 is printed is because the child process exited with -1 status and the shell interprets it as 255.
The reason for this is that the exit status is stored in the lower 8 bits of the status variable and the shell interprets
the exit status as a signed 8 bit integer.
So when the child process exits with -1 status, the status variable will have 0xFFFFFF00 and the shell interprets it as 255.

We can use WEXITSTATUS macro to see the actual exit status of the child process.
