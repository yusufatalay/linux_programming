Assume a system where the value returned by the call sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK) is
100. Assuming that the clock_t value returned by times() is a signed 32-bit 
integer, how long will it take before this value cycles so that it restarts at
0? Perform the same calculation for the CLOCKS_PER_SEC value returned by clock().
