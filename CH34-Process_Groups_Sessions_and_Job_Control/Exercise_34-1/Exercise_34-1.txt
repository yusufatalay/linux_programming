Suppose a parent process performs the following steps:

	// Call fork() to create a number of child processes, each of which
	// remains in same process group as the parent

	// Sometime later...
	signal(SIGURS1, SIG_IGN);	// Parent makes itself ummune to SIGUSR1

	killpg(getpgrp(), SIGUSR1);	// Send signal to children created earlier

What problem might be encountered with this application design? (Consider shell
pipelines.) How could this problem be avoided?
