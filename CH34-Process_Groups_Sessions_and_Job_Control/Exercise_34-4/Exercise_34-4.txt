Modify the program in Listing 34-4 (disc_SIGHUP.c) to verify that, if the controlling
process doesn't terminate as a consequence of receiving SIGHUP (i.e, it instead
ignores or catches the signal and continues execution), then the kernel doesn't
send SIGHUP to the members of the foreground process group.
