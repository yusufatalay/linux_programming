Write a program to verify that if one of the signals SIGTTIN, SIGTOU, or SIGTSTP is sent
to a member of an orphaned process group, then the signal is discarded (i.e, has
no effect) if it would stop the process (i.e, the disposition is SIG_DFL), but is
delivered if a handler is installed for the signal.
