When I run that code (without wait in grandparent) I get the following output:

Grandparent here with PID = 4782
Parent here with PID = 4783 about to exit
Child is here with PID = 0
Parent still alive
Parent still alive
Parent still alive
Parent still alive
Parent still alive
Parent still alive
Parent still alive
Parent gone new parent's PID = 813
Parent here with PID = 4783 about to exit

When we add the wait in the grandparent, we get the following output:

.~/D/t/l/C/zombie_parent (main|✔) $/zombie_parent
Grandparent here with PID = 5184
Parent here with PID = 5185 about to exit
~/D/t/l/C/zombie_parent (main|✔) $ Child is here with PID = 0
Parent gone new parent's PID = 813
Parent here with PID = 5185 about to exit

I think it is safe to assume that child get adopted by init process when parent dies.
