Suppose that we have three processes related as grandparent, parent and child,
and that the grandparent doesn't immediately perform a wait() after the parent
exits, so that the parent becomes a zombie. When do you expect the granchild to
be adopted by init (so that getppid() in the grandchild returns 1): after the parent
terminates or after the grandparent does a wait()? Write a program to verify your
answer.
