When I run the code I get the following output which is quite interesting

 ~/D/t/l/C/orphan_child (main|✔) [1]$ ./orphan_child
Child executing current PPID (parent alive) = 6192
Parent executing current PID = 6192 . I am about to die
~/D/t/l/C/orphan_child (main|✔) [1]$ Parent dead, new parent pid is 824

the PID 824 is systemd's PID on my system, it makes sense now (systemd is second child of init)
