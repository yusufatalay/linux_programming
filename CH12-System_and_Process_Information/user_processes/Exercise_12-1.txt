Write a program that lists the process ID and command name for all processes 
being run by the user named in the program's command-line argument.(You may
find the userIdFromName() function from Listing 8-1, useful.)
This can be done by inspecting the Name: and Uid: lines of all the
/proc/PID/status files on the system. Walking through all the /proc/PID
directories on the system requires the use of readdir(3), which is described in 
Section 18.8. Make sure your program correctly handles the possibility that a
/proc/PID directory disappears between the time that the program determines that
the directory exists and the time that it tries to open corresponding
/proc/PID/status file.
