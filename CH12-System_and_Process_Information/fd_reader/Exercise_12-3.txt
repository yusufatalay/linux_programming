Write a program that lists all processes that have a particular file pathname open.
This can be achieved by inspecting the contents of all of the /proc/PID/fd/* symbolic
links. This will require nested loops employing readdir(3) to scan all /proc/PID
directories, and then the contents of all /proc/PID/fd entries withing each /prod/PID
directory. To read the content of a /proc/PID/fd/n symbolic link requires the use 
of readlink().
