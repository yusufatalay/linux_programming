The server in Listing 44-7 (fifo_seqnum_server.c) always starts assignign sequence
numbers from 0 each time it is started. Modify the program to use a backup file
that is updated each time a sequence number is assigned. (The open() O_SYNC flag,
described in Section 4.3.1, may be useful.) At startup, the program should check
for the existence of this file, and if it is present, use the value it contains 
to initialize the sequence number. If the backup file can't be found on startup,
the program should create a new file and start assigning sequence nubmers beginning at 0.
(An alternative to this technique would be to use memory-mapped files, described in CH49)
