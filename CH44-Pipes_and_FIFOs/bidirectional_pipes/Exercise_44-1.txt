Write a program that uses two pipes to enable bidirectional communication
between a parent and child process. the parent process should loop reading a 
block of text from standard input and use one of the pipes to send the text to the
child, which converts it to uppercase and sends it back to the parent via the other
pipe. The parent reads the data coming back from the child and echoes it on 
standard output before continuing around the loop once more.
