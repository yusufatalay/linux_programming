Aside from the absence of error checking and various variable and structure 
declarations, what is the problem with the following program?

	static void *
	threadFunc(void *arg)
	{
		struct someStruct *pbuf = (struct someStruct *)	 arg;

		// Do some wotk with structure pointed by 'pbuf'
	}

	int
	main (int argc, char *argv[])
	{
		struct someStruct buf;

		pthread_create(&thr, NULL, threadFunc, (void *) &buf);
		pthread_exit(NULL);
	}
